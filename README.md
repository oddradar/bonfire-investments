## Investments Dashboard Project (Bonfire)

A personal, drag-and-drop customizable web app with resizable widgets. Built for me to learn coding, GitHub, and VS Code — and to explore decentralized, user-controlled networks. This project is also intended as a real financial investments dashboard, for anyone to make it their own.

## Overview 
Bonfire Investments is a dashboard designed to blend technical resilience with personal sovereignty. It provides a customizable landing page, movable hamburger menu, and widget-based interface. The project is open-source under the Apache 2.0 License, so others can use, adapt, and contribute.
